## File Description:
* Data aggregation [folder]  
  The directory contains our compiled dye data as well as the collected xanthene  and cyanine datasets.  
    
* MTATFP [folder]  
  The main code for this project, including training data and code for three types of predictive models.  
    
* GUI [folder]  
  The user interaction code for Fluor-predictor. Once the environment is set up, simply run GUI.py to execute it, and the output data will be saved in the Results folder.  
    
* Single-task_and_ML_models [folder]  
  Single-task models and machine learning code for comparison with the MTATFP model.  
    
* User Guide.pdf  
  The specific usage method of Fluor-predictor is based on the runtime environment.
  
* demo_video.mp4  
  The usage demonstration of Fluor-predictor: users simply need to replace the target molecules and solvents.

## Creation of the GUI Usage Environment:  
Please follow these steps to create the working environment.  
* conda create -n dye37 python=3.7
* conda install pytorch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 torchaudio==0.13.1 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
* conda install xlsxwriter
* conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn
* pip install pandas==1.3.0
* pip install dgllife==0.2.8
* pip install rdkit-pypi
* pip install dgl==1.1.2+cu117 -f https://data.dgl.ai/wheels/cu117/repo.html
* pip install packaging
  
There is an error in the AttentiveFP library that needs to be corrected. Here are the steps for the modification: ___In GUI.py, jump to the code in attentivefp.py through AttentiveFPGNN, rename copy_edge to copy_e; rename src_mul_edge to u_mul_e. After the installation is complete, you can run it directly___  
  
## The software interface is shown as follows:
for specific usage, please refer to the User Guide.pdf.

## Atom Weight Visualization:
In the MTATFP folder, we have retained visualization code for all scripts, allowing users to display visualized weights and also to regenerate training files for new data visualization.
